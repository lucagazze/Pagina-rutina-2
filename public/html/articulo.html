                    For most people, it’s not realistic to go to the gym six days per week, which is why most workout programs only prescribe training 3-5 days per week. Not to mention, training nearly every day of the week may not be ideal or even necessary for beginners and intermediate trainees. And if you have an extremely busy schedule, it’s not even worth considering.

                    With that said, a 6-day workout split may be the best option for advanced trainees wanting to continue gaining size and/or strength. Let’s face it, some people enjoy the gym so much that they want to be there every single day. So if you’re a gym rat or an advanced lifter looking to maximize results, a 6-day workout split is something you should consider.

                    Since you’re training six days per week, following a well-structured workout program is essential because you can quickly overtrain. Two of the most popular 6-day workout splits include the upper/lower and push/pull/legs split. A 6-day workout split can be very effective for building muscle, gaining strength, and losing fat, as long as it’s programmed well.
